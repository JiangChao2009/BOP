## Contents<br>
- Ground-truth wrappers to homogenize access to Pascal, COCO, and SBD in `gt_wrappers/` (See `gt_wrappers/README.txt`)
- Pre-computed evaluation to reproduce the paper results in `data/`
- Are you looking for the code of some other part in particular? Let me know and I can send it to you.

## Benchmark of Object Proposals<br>
The comparison of object proposal techniques, is performed using the MCG benchmark code, which is now updated to show the measures used in this paper. Check it [here](https://github.com/jponttuset/mcg) to evaluate your own proposals.
